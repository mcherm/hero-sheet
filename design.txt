Design Notes for MnMSheet

== The Document Tree: ==

I have several different trees of data, each of which could be expressed
in JSON, which overlap. I am figuring out just how to handle them.

(1) The "character save". This consists of only the fields that the
  user enters. Calculated fields (like costs, or actual number of
  ranks) are not included. This is used for saving (or loading) a
  character.

(2) The "character sheet". This consists of the character save plus
  those fields that are calculated (like costs, or actual number of
  ranks). This is used for rendering to the screen.

 (3) The "current state". This consists of the character sheet plus
   some additional data about temporary effects on the character (like
   statuses, currently-activated-powers, and so forth). This is also
   rendered to the screen if desired, and can be cleared out.

 
Modifiers:
  List of Charge Values:
    flatPoints
    flatPointsPerRankOfModifier
    flatPointsPer5PointsOfFinalCost
    pointsOfMultiplier
    pointsOfMultiplierPerRankOfModifier

Naming:
  For licensing reasons, the terms "Hero Points" and "Power Points" must be renamed; they are
  excluded from the open game license. I'm using "Effort Points" for "Hero Points" and
  "Character Points" for "Power Points".

Proposed Design Policy:
  Some fields are actually entered by users. These fields clearly should appear in the
  JSON charsheet. Some fields (costs are a good example) get calculated. Here I think
  there should be a mix of two policies. For fields that get calculated from something
  that lives at a fixed location, do NOT include the calculated field in the charsheet
  but instead calculate it on demand. However, for fields that get calculated based on
  something that is NOT at a fixed location -- something that might or might not
  exist, we should create a standard place for the field to be placed and then create
  watches to update it. I'll want references to those entries so I'll create IDs for
  the individual powers/abilities/whatever that create these and always list them by
  those IDs.

User and Email:
  Every user has 3 fields: "user", "email" and "password". Password is salted, hashed,
  and the salt and hash are saved. Email is optional, and "" is used if it is not
  present. User can EITHER be the same as a non-empty email OR it can be a different
  value which must not have any @ signs. The way we implement this is to write the
  user info file under the user if there is a user and no email, under the email
  if the user and email are the same, and under BOTH places if the email exists and
  is different from the user.

Bug List:

TODO: Some powers (like Invisiblity or Concealment) don't have ranks. I should
  probably categorize those and hide the rank selector for them.

TODO: I can't enter the modifiers for the extra "Area" because it depends on
  two dimensions (shape and ranks) and I don't have support for that (yet).

TODO: I said that the Impervious advantage used "flatPointsPerRankOfModifier".
  I'm not sure that was correct. But then again, I don't know what else it
  would be.

TODO: The ability "Ultimate Effort" should be specific to a particular skill
  (and can be taken multiple times). Also Improved Critical should apply
  to a particular attack.

TODO: For the power "Communication", the extra "Sense-Dependent" isn't really
  a flaw of the power, it is a flaw of any other power

TODO: Campaign limits not implemented yet:
  * For an attack, (Attack bonus + effect rank) <= powerLevel * 2
  * For an attack with resistance, not attack,
    effect Rank <= powerLevel
  * For all campaign limits, should make a list of them and be able to display
    it and even make exceptions for individual ones.

TODO: Need to be able to purchase equipment.

TODO: Generate a PDF.

TODO: [Adran06] Extra sheet for minions. And for Morph[Metamorph]. And for Summon.

TODO: [Adran06] Maybe an "extra sheet" for variable powers? Listing some options (for free)?

TODO: There are power-specific modifiers. I need to:
  * Enter the information into my data files.
  * Write code that displays them.

TODO: The way I display modifiers right now could really use some improvement.

TODO: The Affliction power should select which kind of effect it applies and
  what resists it.

URGENT BUGS:

TODO: At launch of a charsheet I get an error about power updaters!!
