Design Notes for MnMSheet

== The Document Tree: ==

I have several different trees of data, each of which could be expressed
in JSON, which overlap. I am figuring out just how to handle them.

(1) The "character save". This consists of only the fields that the
  user enters. Calculated fields (like costs, or actual number of
  ranks) are not included. This is used for saving (or loading) a
  character.

(2) The "character sheet". This consists of the character save plus
  those fields that are calculated (like costs, or actual number of
  ranks). This is used for rendering to the screen.

 (3) The "current state". This consists of the character sheet plus
   some additional data about temporary effects on the character (like
   statuses, currently-activated-powers, and so forth). This is also
   rendered to the screen if desired, and can be cleared out.

 
Modifiers:
  List of Charge Values:
    flatPoints
    flatPointsPerRankOfModifier
    flatPointsPer5PointsOfFinalCost
    pointsOfMultiplier
    pointsOfMultiplierPerRankOfModifier


Bug List:

TODO: Some powers (like Invisiblity or Concealment) don't have ranks. I should
  probably categorize those and hide the rank selector for them.

TODO: I can't enter the modifiers for the extra "Area" because it depends on
  two dimensions (shape and ranks) and I don't have support for that (yet).

TODO: I said that the Impervious advantage used "flatPointsPerRankOfModifier".
  I'm not sure that was correct. But then again, I don't know what else it
  would be.

TODO: The ability "Ultimate Effort" should be specific to a particular skill
  (and can be taken multiple times). Also Improved Critical should apply
  to a particular attack.

TODO: The skill "Expertise" can alter the ability it is based on (with GM
  permission). That isn't supported at the moment.

TODO: For the power "Communication", the extra "Sense-Dependent" isn't really
  a flaw of the power, it is a flaw of any other power

TODO: Campaign limits not implemented yet:
  * For an attack, (Attack bonus + effect rank) <= powerLevel * 2
  * For an attack with resistance, not attack,
    effect Rank <= powerLevel
  * For all campaign limits, should make a list of them and be able to display
    it and even make exceptions for individual ones.

TODO: Need to be able to purchase equipment.

TODO: Generate a PDF.

TODO: Extra sheet for minions. And for Morph[Metamorph]. And for Summon.

TODO: Maybe an "extra sheet" for variable powers? Listing some options (for free)?

TODO: Display cost on each pane that builds up costs.

TODO: There are power-specific modifiers. I need to:
  * Enter the information into my data files.
  * Write code that displays them.

TODO: The way I display modifiers right now could really use some improvement.

TODO: I need to record (and display) attacks.

TODO: [Adran06] Some advantages should impact other things
  * Improved Initiative should increase initiative
  * Jack-Of-All-Trades should changes skills fro N/A to proper numbers

TODO: [Adran06] Expertise should be able to depend on other abilities besides "Intellect".

TODO: Add a page where users can see information about the application.
