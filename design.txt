Design Notes for MnMSheet

== The Document Tree: ==

I have several different trees of data, each of which could be expressed
in JSON, which overlap. I am figuring out just how to handle them.

(1) The "character save". This consists of only the fields that the
  user enters. Calculated fields (like costs, or actual number of
  ranks) are not included. This is used for saving (or loading) a
  character.

(2) The "character sheet". This consists of the character save plus
  those fields that are calculated (like costs, or actual number of
  ranks). This is used for rendering to the screen.

 (3) The "current state". This consists of the character sheet plus
   some additional data about temporary effects on the character (like
   statuses, currently-activated-powers, and so forth). This is also
   rendered to the screen if desired, and can be cleared out.

 
Special Handling for Powers:
TODO: Some powers (like Invisiblity or Concealment) don't have ranks. I should
  probably categorize those and hide the rank selector for them.

TODO: I can't enter the modifiers for the extra "Area" because it depends on
  two dimensions (shape and ranks) and I don't have support for that (yet).

Modifiers:
  List of Charge Values:
    flatPointsPerRankOfModifier
    flatPoints
    pointsOfMultiplier
